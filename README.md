Car Rental Management System (C++)

This was my first coding project. It is a car rental system designed for easy acess, selection, and payment for a car at a rental company.

From a pre-defined database of 25 cars, users get to filter out their preferred car from categories like price, car model, and days rented. Then once a car is selected, payment options are available. Finally, a ticket is printed to confirm rental car possession. The project is very user-friendly and uses simple concepts like double arrays to create a complex system. 

To run:

enter in terminal: 

g++ car_rental_system.cpp

./a or ./a.out
